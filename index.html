        <h1>America's Favorite Architecture</h1>
        <div class="para">
                <p>"America's Favorite Architecture" is a list of buildings and other structures identified as the most popular
                        works of architecture in the United States.
            
                        In 2006 and 2007, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) sponsored research to identify the most popular
                        works of architecture in the United States. Harris Interactive conducted the study by first polling a sample
                        of the AIA membership and later polling a sample of the public.[1]
            
                        In the first phase of the study, 2,448 AIA members were interviewed and asked to identify their "favorite"
                        structures. Each was asked to name up to 20 structures in each of 15 defined categories. The 248 structures
                        that were named by at least six of the AIA members were then included in a list of structures to be included
                        in the next phase, a survey of the general public. The survey of the public involved a total of 2,214
                        people, each of whom rated many photographs of buildings and other structures drawn from the list of 248
                        structures that had been created by polling the architects. The public's preferences were ranked using a
                        "likeability" scale developed for the study.[1][2]</p>
